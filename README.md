# T-Cloud-Public Node Driver Extension for Rancher

This repository contains a **Rancher UI Extension** that integrates the **T-Cloud-Public machine driver** into Rancher (RKE2).  
It provides a complete UI for configuring OTC machines, managing cloud credentials, and provisioning RKE2 clusters using OTC instances.

This extension replaces the legacy node-driver UI and implements Rancher's new **UI Extensions Framework** (v3+).

## Building and running locally

You can build and run the extensions locally, to do so:

- Run `yarn install`
- Set the `API` environment variable to point to a Rancher backend
- Run Rancher in development mode with `yarn dev`
- Open a web browser to `https://127.0.0.1:8005`

Once you log in, you should see Rancher load with the extensions automatically loaded. You can edit the code for the extensions
and then should hot-reload within the browser.

## Releasing an extension

Currently, releasing works through GitHub pages (need to create more secure way of releasing https://extensions.rancher.io/extensions/next/publishing) [[issue](https://github.com/opentelekomcloud/opentelekomcloud-node-driver-extension/issues/1)]
```bash
yarn publish-pkgs -s "opentelekomcloud/opentelekomcloud-node-driver-extension" -b "gh-pages"
```

Then Open `//rancher.instance/dashboard/c/_/uiplugins` -> `Manage Repositories` -> Create
